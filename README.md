# py_o_and_x
My first project in Pythong is a simple naughts and crosses (tic tac toe) game.

I made this in a Jupyter notebook so the code is a .ipynb file.

This game is based on a coding exercise for a course I am following. 
The solution from the course has some differences with mine. 
Find their solution [here](https://github.com/Pierian-Data/Complete-Python-3-Bootcamp/blob/master/04-Milestone%20Project%20-%201/03-Milestone%20Project%201%20-%20Complete%20Walkthrough%20Solution.ipynb)
